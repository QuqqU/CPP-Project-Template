# Cpp-Project-Template

> This template is based on cmake 3.25. Cmake is notorious for its version.


## Before you start

You have to run the command below. This is needed only once.

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

## Build & Run

After running cmake command, you can run `make` to build and run.
Be careful, `makefile` is in the `build` directory, where you should run `make`.

```shell
make #to build
make run #to build and run
make clean #to clean up your build repository
```

## Caution

This template repository is written for author's local dev env.
Be sure to check all files before use.
